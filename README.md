## Detailed Functionality Guide

### 1. Landing Page

* **Purpose**: Introduces users to Airbus Analytics with a prominent, animated card.
* **Usage**: View metrics or welcome message. This template can be extended to show live data or charts.

### 2. Navbar & Navigation

* **Components**:

  * Brand label: "Airbus Analytics"
  * Links: "Accueil", "Projets", "Contact"
  * Theme toggle: Click to switch modes (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è)
* **Behavior**: Collapsible on smaller screens; remains fixed at top.

### 3. Theme Toggle

* **Goal**: Allow users to choose light or dark theme for readability.
* **Implementation**:

  1. HTML `<html data-theme="light">` default.
  2. CSS variables under `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors.
  3. JS listens for button click, toggles the attribute and icon.

### 4. Animated Cards

* **Library**: Animate.css
* **Example**: `<div class="card animate__animated animate__fadeIn">`
* **Use Case**: Apply animations to new elements or dashboards for better user experience.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Upload Your Data**

   * On the **Accueil** page, click the **Upload** button to select your project data file (CSV, JSON, etc.).
   * After uploading, a confirmation message indicates successful import.
   * **Priority Flag**: In your Excel/CSV file, add a **Priority** column (`TRUE/FALSE` or `1/0`) for each project. The application will automatically highlight prioritized projects.

2. **Choose a Scenario**

   * Navigate to the **Projets** section in the navbar.
   * Select a scenario from the list or use the search bar to find a specific project.
   * Click **View Details** to load the dashboard for that scenario.
   * **Unchosen Projects**: Use the filter option to toggle viewing only projects not marked as priority.

3. **Interacting with the Dashboard**

   * **Metrics Overview**: Key indicators (progress, budget, timeline) appear in animated cards.
   * **Optimizing Curve**: A dynamic curve shows budget vs. outcome based on your data.

     * Drag the budget slider or input a value to see real-time curve updates.
   * **Goal Setting** (Optional): Enter a target KPI (e.g., weight reduction, cost savings).

     * The dashboard highlights on the curve where you need to allocate resources to meet your goal.
   * **Charts & Tables**: Scroll for interactive graphics and data tables.
   * **Filtering**: Use dropdowns to filter by date range, department, or other parameters.

4. **Downloading Reports**

   * Click the **Export** button to download a PDF or Excel report summarizing the selected scenario.
   * Reports include charts, tables, and key insights.

5. **Contact & Support**

   * Go to the **Contact** page and submit a support form if you encounter issues.
   * Our team will follow up with troubleshooting steps and guidance.

When you run the application after uploading your data and choosing a scenario, the dashboard presents real-time metrics, optimization curves, goal visualizations, and downloadable reports, empowering data-driven decisions for your Airbus projects.

## Customization & Theming

* **Fonts**: Change `font-family` in `style.css` to any system serif or imported font.
* **Colors**: Adjust CSS variables in `:root` for your brand colors.
* **Animations**: Add other Animate.css classes (e.g., `animate__zoomIn`) to elements.
* **Additional Pages**: Duplicate `index.html` as a base and update the content area for new routes.
